## You never have to kill a cow again!

(At least in regards to crafting books)

I love the book recipe added by tinkers and wanted something like it without needing
to add tinkers.  So I threw together this mod and it kinda grew a bit from there.

## Features

* Adds the ability to get bark pieces from wood logs
* Can use the bark to make book covers

## Planned Features

* Bark themed bookshelves!

## Credits

Tinkers for the idea and many credits to Elucent and Roots for some of their 
bark/knife assets
